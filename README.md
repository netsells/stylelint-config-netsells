# Netsells Stylelint Config

This repository contains the defacto-standard stylelint configuration used on all Netsells projects, both internally and client.

## Usage

Add the config to your project dependencies:

```bash
yarn add netsells/stylelint-config-netsells stylelint 
```

Now extend the config in your project. For example, a `.stylelintrc` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-netsells"
}
```

### With webpack

Add the eslint-loader to your project:

```bash
yarn add eslint-loader
```

Add the loader into your workflow. The following example will force the linter to be ran before other loaders such as babel compilation. This means we lint the raw ES6 code rather than the transpiled ES5 output:

```js
{
    plugins: [
        new StyleLintPlugin({
            configFile: './.stylelintrc',
            files: './resources/assets/less/**/*.less',
        }),
    ],
},
```
